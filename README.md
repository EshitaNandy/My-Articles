I think all aspiring and passionate writers like me will agree when I say that </br>
#### ‘We are never fully satisfied with our work. We always feel that we can do better and that our best piece is yet to be written’. </br>

“I don’t start out writing good stuff at the beginning. I start by making a draft and thinking it’s good stuff, and then gradually I get better at it.</br>
That’s why I say one of the most valuable traits is persistence.” </br>
